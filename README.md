# SmartCart
Standing in long checkout queues at the shopping center is often a very time-consuming process for both customer and shopkeeper. Specially in these corona times, where social distancing is must forming long queues must be avoided. This forms the motivation of this research work. The aim of this research work is to implement a smart cart that will generate the inventory of the collected items as we are adding them to the cart. The cart will also generate the bill based on the inventory and display it on the mobile application where the consumers can pay also and does not have to stand in the long checkout queues. This objective is achieved by attaching the ordinary cart with raspberry pi and camera sensors.
